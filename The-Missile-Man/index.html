        <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, was an Indian aerospace scientist and the 11th President of India. He played a crucial role in India's missile development and nuclear weapons programs, earning him the title "Missile Man of India." Kalam worked extensively with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), contributing to India's advancements in space and defense technology.
        His leadership was instrumental in the success of the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, which established India as a nuclear power.
